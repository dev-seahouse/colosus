## Creating a Mandate

Before you can make any payments you have to first create a Mandate. To create a new mandate you must have already created a party and bank account.

The bank account number and sort code used to create the mandate must be able to pass a Modulus check. To test on sandbox, you should use 55779911 as the account number and 20-00-00 as the sort code.
